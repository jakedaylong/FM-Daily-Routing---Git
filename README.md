# FM Daily Routing

FM Daily Routing is a small python project designed to facilitate the rapid creation of orders to be uploaded to a Fleet Management System, in their desired format, for a team that performs fixed route deliveries. The intent is to save time for the dispatchers and avoid creating these orders by hand by generating an .xlsx document ready for upload. 

Configuration files are needed to associate drivers to routes and drivers to vehicles. These could be edited on the fly by a user in order to quickly account for absenses or change over.
